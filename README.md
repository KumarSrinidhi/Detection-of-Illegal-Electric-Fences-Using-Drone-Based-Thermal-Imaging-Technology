# Detection-of-Illegal-Electric-Fences-Using-Drone-Based-Thermal-Imaging-Technology
This project proposes a scalable, non-invasive method to detect illegal electric fences in farms and forests using drone-mounted thermal cameras. By identifying heat signatures from high-voltage currents, it helps prevent fatal electrocutions of humans and wildlife.
